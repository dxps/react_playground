# react_ts_tiptap_ex1

This is a first example (or tryout) of using Shadcn/ui's [Minimal Tiptap](https://www.shadcn.io/components/forms/minimal-tiptap) component.

It is fine as a starter. It doesn't support images, nor tables or links yet.

The project was created using [Bun](https://bun.com) v1.3.1 and it is based on "bun-react-tailwind-shadcn-template".
